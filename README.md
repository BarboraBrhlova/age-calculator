## Overview

I worked on Age calculator app solution using HTML, CSS (SCSS for the first time) and JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
-   Receive validation errors if:
    -   Any field is empty when the form is submitted
    -   The day number is not between 1-31
    -   The month number is not between 1-12
    -   The year is in the future
    -   The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
-   **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

I am learning how to use SCSS to make my code more effective. As beginner I was working with vanilla JS only but I would like to try some libraries in future.

-   [Stack-overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me with JavaScript functions.
-   [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I'd recommend it to anyone still learning basics of CSS and JS.
